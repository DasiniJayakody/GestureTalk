# GestureTalk ✋🗣️

**GestureTalk** is a real-time hand gesture recognition and voice feedback system built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **pyttsx3**.

It identifies specific hand gestures through webcam input, displays the gesture name on screen, and uses offline text-to-speech (TTS) to pronounce it — providing a simple and effective form of visual-to-auditory communication.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Real-time gesture detection using MediaPipe
- ✅ Gesture classification without machine learning (rule-based)
- ✅ Text-to-speech (TTS) output using `pyttsx3`
- ✅ On-screen gesture display
- ✅ Supports gestures like:
  - Open Hand ✋
  - Fist ✊

## 🌍 Real-World Value

GestureTalk can be used as a foundation for:
- 🔉 Voice-based accessibility tools
- 🤟 Real-time sign language interpreters (basic version)
- 🎓 Educational tools for learning hand gestures or signs
- 🤖 Human-computer interaction (gesture-to-command)

This project demonstrates how computer vision + voice synthesis can empower **inclusive and assistive technology** for users with hearing or speech impairments.
